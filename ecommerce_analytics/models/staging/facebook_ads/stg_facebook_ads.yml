    description: >
      Staging model for Facebook Ads daily performance metrics
      with computed advertising KPIs.
      
      **Source:** ECOMMERCE_RAW.FACEBOOK_ADS.AD_PERFORMANCE
      
      **Grain:** One row per ad per day
      
      **Primary Key:** (ad_id, performance_date) — composite key
      
      **Transformations applied:**
      - Added time dimensions (week, month, year, quarter)
      - Computed standard advertising KPIs (CTR, CPC, CPM, CPA, CVR)
      - Added performance tier classification based on CTR
      - Added boolean delivery and activity flags
      
      **Important Note on NULL Metrics:**
      CTR, CPC, CPM, CPA, and CVR use NULLIF to avoid division by
      zero. NULL values are intentional and indicate no activity
      in the denominator (e.g., no impressions = NULL CTR).
      Use COALESCE or conditional aggregation in downstream models.
      
      **Performance Tier Thresholds:**
      Based on CTR: high >= 4%, medium >= 2%, low >= 1%, else underperforming.
      No delivery = 0 impressions that day.
