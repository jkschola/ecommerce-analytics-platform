  - name: stg_shopify__orders
    description: >
      Staging model for Shopify order transactions with financial
      metrics and status classification.
      
      **Source:** ECOMMERCE_RAW.SHOPIFY.ORDERS
      
      **Grain:** One row per order
      
      **Primary Key:** order_id
      
      **Transformations applied:**
      - Added time dimensions (day, week, month, year, quarter)
      - Derived revenue, refund_amount, and net_revenue_impact
      - Added boolean status flags for clean downstream filtering
      - Renamed columns for naming consistency
      
      **Important Note on total_amount:**
      Refunded orders carry a negative total_amount in the source system.
      Never use total_amount directly for revenue aggregations.
      Always use revenue (completed only) or net_revenue_impact (net of refunds).
