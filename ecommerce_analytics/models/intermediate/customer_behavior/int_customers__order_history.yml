models:
  - name: int_customers__order_history
    description: >
      Intermediate model aggregating complete order history per customer.
      
      **Source models:**
      - stg_shopify__orders (aggregated)
      
      **Grain:** One row per customer_id
      
      **Primary Key:** customer_id
      
      **Purpose:** Reusable customer-level metrics consumed by:
      - dim_customers (marts/core)
      - Any future customer segmentation models
      
      **Key Business Logic:**
      - Revenue: completed orders only
      - Refund rate: total_refunds / total_revenue
      - Customer segment: based on completed_orders + total_revenue
      - Recency tier: based on days_since_last_order
      
      **Important Note on Date Metrics:**
      days_since_last_order and days_as_customer use current_timestamp()
      so values change daily. Snapshot this model if point-in-time
      history is required.
